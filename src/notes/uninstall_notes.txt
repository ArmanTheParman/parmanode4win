Too complicated to delete the script directory if the script is running from it.
I'll leave it for now even if there is an uninstallation.
Or, I could never have it download in the first place and just run from exe alone.
Having the repo downloaded is useful for updates though.

If user is running Parmanode4Win.exe from Program Files, then it could delete the script directory.
